      <img src="assets/images/austin.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Austin Alber">

      <p>My name is Austin Alber, I am a 22 year old student currently persuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering while also attending UCF's Coding Bootcamp. I am currently enrolled at University of Central Florida and plan to graduate in May of 2020.</p>

      <p>Some hobbies of mine include: playing recreational soccer, practicing guitar, fishing along the Eastern coast of Florida, and relaxing on the beach with friends.</p>

      <p>Over the past two years my desire to study different coding languages has grown and I now hope to someday begin a career focused around my Engineering degree and coding. I still have much to learn and cannot wait to see what my future has in store for me.</p>
